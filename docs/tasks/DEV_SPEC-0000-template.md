### 5. Definition of Done (DoD)

A Product Backlog Item (e.g., a User Story or a Task) is considered "Done" when all of the following criteria are met:

*   **Code Quality:** The code is written and formatted according to the guidelines in `docs/CODING_STYLE.md` (`black .`, `ruff check .`).
*   **Tests:**
    *   All new backend functions are covered by unit tests.
    *   The end-to-end functionality is verified by an integration test.
    *   All existing tests continue to pass (no regressions).
*   **Acceptance Criteria:** All acceptance criteria defined for the story have been met and manually verified in the frontend.
*   **Code Review:** The code has been reviewed by at least one other team member (or is in a reviewable state in a pull request).
*   **Merge:** The code has been successfully merged into the main development branch (e.g., `main` or `develop`).
*   **Documentation:** Necessary changes to technical documentation (e.g., new ADRs, if required) have been made.
